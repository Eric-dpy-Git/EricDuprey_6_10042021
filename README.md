-------- Welcome on my sixth Openclassrooms project -------

A project which aims to understand the functioning of an MVC (Model-View-Controller) type application with the management of a database, the principle of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and compliance with the recommendations of the OWASP (Open, Web, Application, Security, Project).

To use the application follow the steps below :

1 - Clone or download the repository up here ;

2 - Unzip and open the repo in your favorite code editor ;

3 - Create a file --> .env <-- in backend folder ;

4 - Copy and paste the elements that I sent you previously in this .env file or ask me thems on :

        eric.dpy@gmail.com

5 - With your Terminal : go in "backend" folder and execute the following commands :

        npm install
        npm start

6 - You need to see :

        Listening on port 3000
        Connexion à MongoDB réussie !

7 - Now with your Terminal again : go in "frontend" folder and execute the following command :

        ng serve

8 - After a while, you need to see :

        ℹ ｢wdm｣: Compiled successfully.

9 - To finish, in the address bar of your usual browser, insert :

        http://localhost:4200/

10 - Great ! Your application is ready to use...

        You can create users, add, edit sauces and you'll find already two sauces for demonstration that you can like or dislike.
